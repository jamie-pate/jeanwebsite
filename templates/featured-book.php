    <h2>Millicent Marvel &amp; Bentley Bunny</h2>
    <h3>A Storybook Quilt</h3>
    <p class="book-passage">Millicent Marvel left Bentley Bunny outside in the cold last night.<br>Her Gramma will make Bentley a quilt to warm up in but Millicent must choose a pattern.<br>Decisions, decisions.</p>
    <p class="book-explanation">Discover a new world where animals from the quilt come alive...</p>
    <p class="book-snippets">Let's stitch a quilt to wrap him up in.<br>Come, pick a pattern from my old cookie tin.</p>
    <p class="book-snippets">This skunk cabbage pattern might work, don't you think?<br>Uh uh, then Bunny really would stink.</p>
    <p class="book-explanation">These are just some of the lines to be found in this delightful childâ€™s picture book. The vibrant colors and textures jump from the pages and stimulate the senses of children and quilters alike. The book evolved from a quilt and poem I created for one of my grand-daughters.</p>
